This repository contains the R datasets and scripts needed to replicate all analyses behind my paper "The Party-Political Integration of Members with a Migrant Background". 

The script "Field Experiment Analysis.R" interacts with the dataset "F1.RData" to replicate the analyses of the field experiment.

The script "Survey Analysis.R" interacts with the datasets "S0.RData" and "S1.RData" to replicate the survey analses and the conjoint experiment.

If there are any questions or uncertainties about any parts of the code/data, feel free to reach out to me under the twitter account linked on my GitHub profile, or my institutional e-mail address: joris.frese@eui.eu.
