This repository contains the R datasets and scripts needed to replicate all analyses behind my paper "The Party-Political Integration of Members with a Migrant Background". 

The script "Field Experiment Analysis.R" interacts with the dataset "F1.RData" to replicate the analyses of the field experiment.

The script "Survey Analysis.R" interacts with the datasets "S0.RData" and "S1.RData" to replicate the survey analyses and the conjoint experiment.

All data has been sufficiently anonymized so that individual local party chapters or politicians can not be identified. This anonymization was promised to the study subjects and I will thus not be able to provide you with the de-anonymized data.

If there are any questions or uncertainties about any parts of the code/data, feel free to reach out to me under the twitter account linked on my GitHub profile, or my institutional e-mail address: joris.frese@eui.eu.
